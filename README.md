## description

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general N queens problem of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. You can read about the problem on its Wikipedia page: Eight queens puzzle.


You will receive a (possibly large) number N and have to place N queens on a N×N chessboard, so that no two queens attack each other. This requires that no two queens share the same row, column or diagonal. You will also receive the mandatory position of one queen. This position is given 0-based with 0 <= row < N and 0 <= col < N. The coordinates {0, 0} are in the top left corner of the board. For many given parameters multiple solutions are possible. You have to find one of the possible solutions, all that fit the requirements will be accepted.


You have to return the solution board as a string, indicating empty fields with '.' (period) and Queens with 'Q' (uppercase Q), ending each row with '\n'.


If no solution is possible for the given parameters, return None.


Notes on Rust version:

    input parameters are size and (mandatory_column, mandatory_row)
    there are 8 tests for very small boards (N <= 10)
    there are 8 tests for cases without solution
    there are 5 tests for small boards (10 < N <= 50)
    there are 5 tests for medium boards (100 < N <= 500)
    there are 5 tests for large boards (500 < N <= 1000)

Example:

For input of size=8, mandatory column=3 and mandatory row=0, your solution could return:

	"...Q....\n......Q.\n..Q.....\n.......Q\n.Q......\n....Q...\nQ.......\n.....Q..\n"

giving the following board:

	...Q....
	......Q.
	..Q.....
	.......Q
	.Q......
	....Q...
	Q.......
	.....Q..

(Other solutions to this example are possible and accepted. The mandatory queen has to be in its position, in the example in the first row at col=3, row=0.)

## partial solution

### simple backtracking

At first , I just want to use simple backtracking, but from the row with the fixed queen. by searching the solution line by line until we find one solution or go through all the situation to show it has no solution. It gives correct result but timeout for large size tests

### bitoperation backtracking
Similar to normal backtracking, but use bit operation to improve the speed.It is still not fast enough

### miniconflict
The main idea is find the queen with most conflict and change its position. This way is much faster than normal backtracking but for this problem, it is hard to find the situation with no solution, and with one fixed posion queen, it is much less efficient than normal situation
